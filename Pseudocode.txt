Simple Java program to correct the test and calculate the final score and percentage of correct answers for the student ------ "ExamGrader"

1- Ideas for Chapters 1-8


2- Scanner Library
3- ExamGrader CLASS,main method
4- array char Because they are letters {the answers A,B,D,C,A...........};
5- numberOfQuestions: The number of questions in the test is determined using the length of the correct answer matrix 
6-StudentAnswers matrix: Matrix for storing answers
7- Create a Scanner object: to read user input 
8- Print Statement: Asking the user to enter his answers for each question 
9- (for loop) Q and enter 10 answers
10- Enter the user (student answer) and choose the first letter of it
11- dif the score with zero and "loop to verify each student's answer against the correct answer"
12- Print Result: Displays the number of correct answers and the total number of questions
13- Calculate percentage: Convert score to percentage using score/(double) numberOfQuestions to ensure that you accurately 
calculate as a decimal, then multiply it by 100
14- Output format to display the percentage with a resolution of up to two decimal places
15- Close the Scanner object


test
Start Program

    // Step 1: Define the correct answers
    correctAnswers = [A, B, C, D, A, C, B, D, A, C]

    // Step 2: Get the number of questions
    numberOfQuestions = length of correctAnswers

    // Step 3: Initialize an array to store student's answers
    studentAnswers = Create an array with size numberOfQuestions

    // Step 4: Set up the scanner for user input
    scanner = Create a new Scanner object

    // Step 5: Collect answers from the user
    Print "Enter the student's answers for the " + numberOfQuestions + " questions:"
    For i from 1 to numberOfQuestions:
        Print "Question " + i + ":"
        studentAnswer = scanner.nextChar()  // Read the next character from user
        studentAnswers[i - 1] = studentAnswer  // Store the answer in the array

    // Step 6: Calculate the score
    score = 0
    For i from 0 to numberOfQuestions - 1:
        If studentAnswers[i] == correctAnswers[i]:
            score = score + 1  // Increment score for each correct answer

    // Step 7: Calculate the percentage of correct answers
    percentage = (score / numberOfQuestions) * 100

    // Step 8: Display the results
    Print "The student's score is: " + score + " out of " + numberOfQuestions
    Print "The percentage is: " + percentage formatted to two decimal places + "%"

    // Step 9: Close the scanner
    scanner.close()

    End Program
